This project is not the original heatmap, it is a meta repo with modified version of [heatmap](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/gie-shiny-heatmap).
This version includes packages version locks, necessary to install it in a docker env without the concerns of conflicting version.

See [the original heatmap repository](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/gie-shiny-heatmap) for more informations about heatmap itself.
